# Password Generator

[![Password-Generator][product-screenshot]](https://code-owl.github.io/Secure-PW-Generator/) 

### Project Usage

This project is for people who want to create a strong password as fast and as simple as possible. Using a strong password is essential because it helps protect our personal and sensitive information from unauthorized access. What makes a good secure password? The key aspects of a strong password are:

- mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols,
- sufficient length (the longer the better),
- no personal information,
- no dictionary words.
